# Malware-Detection-in-PE-files-using-ML  
Every thing about this project is explained in detail in FER(Final Evaluation report).  
  
## Project Description  
This project aims to detect malware in PE (Portable Executable) files using Machine Learning techniques. We have developed a model that analyzes PE files and predicts whether they contain malware or not using hybrid static malware analysis(combination of PE Headers, byte-n-grams and opcode-n-grams features). This project can be a valuable tool in enhancing cybersecurity measures and protecting systems against malicious software/files.
   
## Dataset(s):  
1. PE files csv, containing metadata, header information.  
2. byte and asm raw files, from kaggle microsoft malware classification challenge 2015.  
  
## Preprocessing/Feature Extraction:  
  
### For Dataset-1:  
1. Extracting PE Header information from PE files.  
  
### For Dataset-2:  
1. Extracting N-grams from byte(byte-n-grams, where n= 1,2) and asm files(opcode-n-grams, where n= 1,2,3,4).
