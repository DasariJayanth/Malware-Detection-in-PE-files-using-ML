# Malware-Detection-in-PE-files-using-ML
Every thing about this project is explained in detail in FER(Final Evaluation report).

## Problem Statement
Our project aims to combat the ever-growing menace of malware by developing an intelligent system capable of detecting malicious intent lurking within PE files. With cyber threats becoming more sophisticated and elusive, traditional detection methods fall short, leaving systems vulnerable to attack.

Through the power of machine learning and advanced feature extraction techniques, we delve deep into the intricate details of PE files, uncovering hidden patterns and indicators of malicious behavior. By deciphering the pe files content, our project distinguuishes the malware files from the normal. 

This project focuses on addressing the pressing challenge of malware detection within PE files through the application of machine learning techniques. With the continuous evolution and sophistication of malware, traditional signature-based detection methods struggle to keep pace, necessitating innovative approaches for accurate identification and classification.


This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based solution for detecting malware in PE (Portable Executable) files. By analyzing the intricate characteristics and structures of PE files, including header information, sections, function calls, and file content, the system aims to uncover hidden patterns indicative of malicious behavior. Through the application of feature extraction, selection, and classification algorithms, the system distinguishes between benign and malicious files, enhancing overall security. The project contributes to advancing malware detection methodologies, offering a proactive defense against evolving cyber threats and ensuring the protection of computer systems and sensitive data.
